###Stylebot

A Google Chrome extension that allows users to manipulate a web pageâ€™s appearance in a WYSIWYG manner.

Using Stylebot, users are able to:

1. Incrementally build custom stylesheets for Chrome.
2. Save custom CSS rules for sites. The next time they visit a site, their custom CSS is already applied.

###About

This project began as a Google Summer of Code 2010 project, where 
original author, Ankit Ahuja, was mentored by Rachel Shearer.
He has since continued to maintain it and build new features.
Along the way, few people have contributed new features and bugfixes.

In 2017, this fork was released to correct a rule storage bug, 
provide some additional features, and remove the social features
that are, unfortunately, no longer available on stylebot.me.
